🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and identify key demographic and lifestyle risk factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking, exercise, and alcohol consumption.

The dashboard helps in understanding both existing heart disease cases and high-risk populations, supporting data-driven healthcare insights.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the overall prevalence of cardiovascular disease

Study heart disease distribution across different age groups

Compare heart disease prevalence between males and females

Assess the impact of lifestyle factors (smoking & exercise)

Analyze alcohol consumption patterns in relation to heart disease

Identify high-risk population based on multiple health indicators


📊 Dashboard Highlights

Total Population: 309K

Heart Disease Cases: 25K

Heart Disease Prevalence: ~8.1%

Average BMI: 28.63

High-Risk Population (%): Identified using age, BMI, smoking, and exercise

📈 Key Visualizations

Heart Disease Cases by Age Group

Heart Disease Prevalence by Gender

Overall Heart Disease Distribution

Heart Disease % by Exercise Habit

Heart Disease Rate by Smoking Habit

Average Alcohol Consumption by Heart Disease Status




🧠 Key Insights

Heart disease prevalence increases significantly with age

Males show a higher prevalence compared to females

Smokers have nearly double the heart disease rate of non-smokers

Lack of physical exercise is strongly associated with higher risk

Lifestyle habits play a crucial role in cardiovascular health
